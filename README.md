## Instructions
- Create a Tic Tac Toe game you can play in your browser.
- You’re going to store the gameboard as an array inside of a Gameboard object. Your players are also going to be stored in objects, and you’re probably going to want an object to control the flow of the game itself.
-- Your main goal here is to have as little global code as possible. Try tucking as much as you can inside factories.
-- Each little piece of functionality should be able to fit in the game, player or gameboard objects.
- Focus on getting a working game in the console first. 
- Once you have a working console game, create an object that will handle the display/DOM logic.
- Write the functions that allow players to add marks to a specific spot on the board by interacting with the appropriate DOM elements.
- Clean up the interface to allow players to put in their names, include a button to start/restart the game and add a display element that shows the results upon game end!
